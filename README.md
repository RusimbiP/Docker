# Docker
## **A container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

# Difference between container and VMs
Virtual machines (VM) are managed by a hypervisor and utilize VM hardware (a), while container systems provide operating system services from the underlying host and isolate the applications using virtual-memory hardware (b).
